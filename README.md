# AVH-X2700BS-reuse
I want to try and reuse parts of the Pioneer double din radio. 


Part list - http://parts.pioneerelectronics.com/model.asp?modelNum=AVH-X2700BS
Service manual - https://www.manualslib.com/manual/1246425/Pioneer-Avh-X2700bs.html?page=1#manual


I am not sure what I am going for with this reuse. The radio was prone to issue with the cold weather. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLE9iovgsxo
